# Star Wars App

## Project Overview

This application is a web application that lists various starships in the Star Wars universe and displays detailed information about a selected starship. Users can search and filter starships by their names or models, and view detailed information about any selected starship.

### Technologies Used

- React: Responsible for managing the user interface and components.
- React Router: Handles page navigation and management of detail pages.
- axios: Used for making API requests to retrieve starship data from SWAPI (Star Wars API).

#### Workflow

Upon application startup, the list of starships is fetched from SWAPI.
On the main page, starships are listed and users can perform search and filter operations.
When a user clicks on a starship, a detail page opens up showing detailed information about the selected starship.
The detail page includes a back link for returning to the main page.
This project leverages modern web technologies to create an interactive and informative experience for Star Wars enthusiasts, allowing them to explore and learn about different starships within the vast Star Wars universe.
